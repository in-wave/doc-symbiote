## Philosophy

> Symbiote.js is built upon a modern web platform features and utilize native browser APIs
instead of using an excess abstractions. Symbiote.js - is what you get after Occam's razor
done it's work.

> Symbiote.js is agnostic. It works in browser and that means it works with any other technology
that interacts with browser APIs. It makes it useful for manage complex interactions between 
multiple system parts without a pain. It makes Symbiote the best choice for building embedded
solutions and to build integration products.

> Symbiote.js is minimal, but has everything you need for  You don't need to search and install
more and more libraries for the data management, table rendering, component styling, dynamic application 
localization or many of other common purposes. You have everything you need out of the box, because 
browser have. We just make your work more convenient.

> Symbiote.js doesn't hide platform APIs behind opaque abstraction levels. You have an access to
everything you see as the result of component rendering.

> Symbiote.js is extensible. You can extend your base component class to feat your needs. You can 
add your own features. You can integrate your application APIs into the base class with ease. 

> Symbiote.js is friendly for the new kind of dependency sharing. It's easy to share common code among
the different subsystems (micro-frontends, widgets, meta-applications).

> We believe that simple things should stay simple and all the complications should fit to their purposes.
